The tools are defined in a nested structure. First you have the application, then the route within that application.

For example, to call the `/exec` route from the `com.example.pyexec` application, you would write:
<rica package="com.example.pyexec" route="/exec">{\"code\": \"1+1\"}</rica>

The definitions show which routes can be run in the background and their timeouts.
