prompt_4 = """Here is the guidance to call a tool:

For example, when you want to call the tool with package `com.example.app` and route `/send_message` to send a message to the user, you can call it like this:
<rica package="com.example.app" route="/send_message">[{"type":"text","content":"Hello, world!"}]</rica>
For a long-time tool like execution, you can specifically call it with background and timeout (in ms) options:
<rica package="com.example.app" route="/send_message" background="true" timeout="10000">[{"type":"text","content":"Hello, world!"}]</rica>

For a non-background tool, you will got the result immediately like:
<rica-callback>{"status":"success"}</rica-callback>
or a error caused like:
<rica-callback>{"status":"error","error":"Something went wrong."}</rica-callback>

For a background tool, your calling will be modified with a uuid like:
<rica package="com.example.app" route="/send_message" callid="1234-xxxx-7890">[{"type":"text","content":"Hello, world!"}]</rica>
and you will got a callback like:
<rica-callback callid="1234-xxxx-7890">{"status":"success"}</rica-callback>
