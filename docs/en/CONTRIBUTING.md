# Contributing to RiCA

We love your input! We want to make contributing to RiCA as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Use Github Flow

We use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes happen through pull requests.

## Report bugs using Github's [issue tracker](https://github.com/rica-team/rica-server/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/rica-team/rica-server/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happened
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
